## My process
1. I started by following the process advice given.
2. I started with listing out the HTML tags I will use and made the HTML layout of the project.
3. Then I linked to the HTML to the CSS and styled my work.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Query for the Mobile app

### What I learned

I learned a proper way to start programming by starting with the HTML first then the CSS. I also learned how to do CSS variables.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
:root {
    --font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
